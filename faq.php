                                Currently, we are operational in Mumbai,
                                Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore and Delhi / NCR.
                                But we definitely have plans for expansion. Like us
                                on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to be updated on where we are moving next.

                                2. Who are Timesaverz service partners?
                            </p>
                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                We aggregate the best service executives across our areas of operation, certify
                                their skill sets, conduct a background check and train them on soft skills before
                                connecting them to customers on need basis. We have enough and more executives
                                spread throughout the cities we operate in who can be made available to the customer
                                at the time the job has been requested for.
                            </p>

                                3. Is Timesaverz accountable for job quality?

                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                Yes, we, and our service partners are 100% accountable for the job undertaken.
                                However, in case of anything going wrong, we are committed to either re-do it or refund your money.
                            </p>

                                4. Does someone have to be at home while the work is getting done?

                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                We strongly recommend YES, as our experience tells us that executive's on-site queries /
                                clarifications are best handled if the you are around.
                            </p>

                                5. What if the Timesaverz service partner doesn't reach on time?
                            </p>
                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                We can arrange for replacement at a time convenient to you or accept a job cancellation
                                from your end with full refund of booking amount, in case you have pre paid for the service.

                                6. What if job takes more than the estimated time quoted by Timesaverz?
                            </p>
                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                Normally, it doesn't happen as the service partners do have back-to-back jobs. However,
                                the partners have been trained to inform in advance in case they anticipate that the job
                                would take longer than expected once they reach the site. Half an hour, more or less,
                                than the estimated time is a given and there's no price alteration that comes in within
                                that margin of error. At the end of day, we leave it to your fair judgement to decide.

                                7. What if I have to reschedule or cancel the job booked on Timesaverz?

                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                We do understand that last minute changes may, at times, necessitate a reschedule or
                                cancellation of job. However, you would also understand that once you have confirmed a
                                job, the executives are already assigned to the job and hence liable for a loss of income
                                opportunity. We would accept cancellations by retaining 5% of the booked amount till about
                                3 hours before the assigned job time. Post that, you can only reschedule or pay 50% of the
                                charges to make up for the loss that the executive would have to bear due to last minute
                                cancellation. Reschedule and cancellation requests can be made through "my Account Page"
                                through a single click within permitted time limits.

                                8. Do the Timesaverz service partners bring their own supplies / will I have to arrange for it?

                            <p class="faq-answer font-weight-regular">
                                All Timesaverz service partners bring in their own supplies. However, consumables such as bulb,
                                ladder, and spare parts have to be made available at your end or bought on actuals before work starts.
